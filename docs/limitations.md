# Limitations

This methodology represents an exploratory pilot designed to offer insights into economic conditions using alternative data sources, particularly in scenarios where traditional data is not available. However, like all data types, mobility data comes with inherent limitations and assumptions that must be considered during analysis and interpretation.

A primary limitation stems from the data collection process. Mobility data is gathered through convenience sampling, which captures only those individuals who have enabled GPS tracking on their devices, rather than a randomized, representative sample of the broader population. This can introduce biases and limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the data may not fully account for the movements of individuals who do not use GPS-enabled devices or have location services disabled.

**Common Limitations and Assumptions Associated with Mobility Data:**

**Limitations:**

- **Sampling Bias:** Mobility data is collected through convenience sampling, lacking the rigor of randomized sampling methods.

- **Selection Bias:** The data may reflect only the behavior of individuals who choose to share their mobility information, potentially leading to selection bias.

- **Privacy Concerns:** Collecting mobility data can raise privacy issues, as it may be linked to individuals, potentially compromising their privacy.

- **Data Quality:** Variations in data quality, including errors or missing data points, can impact the reliability of analyses.

- **Temporal and Spatial Resolution:** The data may not capture all movements or may lack sufficient detail in temporal and spatial resolution, affecting its applicability.

- **Lack of Contextual Information:** Mobility data primarily provides movement patterns and location information but may lack additional contextual details such as transactional data or specific economic activities necessary for accurate economic analysis.

- **Private Intent Data:** The methodology relies on data collected for purposes other than the research question at hand. This "private intent data" was repurposed for analysis. Limitations and trade-offs of such approch are discussed in the [World Development Report 2021](https://wdr2021.worldbank.org) in detail.

**Assumptions:**

- **Homogeneity:** The analysis often assumes that mobility patterns are consistent across time and space, which may not always be the case.

- **Consistency in Data Sources:** There may be an assumption of consistency in data collection methods and sources across different regions or datasets, which might not be accurate.

- **User Behavior:** Assumptions about user behavior, such as travel purposes or route preferences, are often made when interpreting the data.

- **Implicit Data Interpretation:** The interpretation of mobility data generally assumes that observed behaviors or patterns have specific meanings, which may not always be accurate without additional context.

- **App Usage as a Proxy:** In some cases, the usage of specific apps or devices is used as a proxy for mobility data, assuming it accurately represents individual movements.

Despite these limitations, monitoring changes in device density over time provides valuable insights into population behavior during crises and can offer actionable information to support public policy and disaster response efforts. Being aware of these limitations and assumptions is crucial when working with mobility data. Researchers and analysts should consider their potential impact on conclusions and seek ways to address these limitations and validate assumptions during their analyses.
